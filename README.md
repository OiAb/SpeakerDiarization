# SpeakerDiarization

In order to simplify the independent recording of podcasts, Vib3s develops a system offering speaker diarization (find within an audio file who is speaking at what time).
Thus, the intervention is based on the study of different already existing solutions to test software implementations on a corpus of audio files, compare their performance, and suggest specific areas/algorithmic solutions to improve the podcast issue.

Technologies : TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pyannote, SpeechBrain, Librosa, S4D, End-to-end neural diarization, ASR, IBC, PCA, JFA, scikit-learn, K-means, PLDA, Pandas, Python, Jupyter, Colab.
